          interest at an early age and learned to play the guitar at the age of 8.</p>

        <p class="info__text">In 2004, he expressed interest in becoming a DJ after seeing Dutch DJ Tiësto perform at
          that year's Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony in Athens. He took particular inspiration from the track
          "Traffic," prompting him to download the specialist software FL Studio, and enabling him to start composing.

        <p class="info__text">In 2013, he graduated from the Herman Brood Academy, a production school in Utrecht. </p>

          for the brand's "Fall Winter 2018" campaign was released in August 2018, featuring Garrix wearing the brand's
          new clothing line. His collaboration track with Loopers, "Game Over," was used for the video. The
          behind-the-scenes footage during the filming was also released by Armani Exchange. </p>

        <h3 class="info__heading">Philanthropy</h3>
        <p class="info__text">In May 2016, Garrix headlined an event in Los Angeles with all proceeds going to the
          non-profit organization Fuck Cancer, dedicated to early detection, prevention and providing support to those
          affected by cancer.</p>

        <p class="info__text">In November 2016, Garrix started his India tour with a special charity show in Mumbai with
          over 62,000 in attendance. Hosted at the Mahalaxmi Racecourse, the charity event's purpose was to educate
          Indian children with the proceeds from the show being donated to Magic Bus, who will be supporting the
          education of 10,000 children across the country. </p>

        <p class="info__text">On 24 February 2017, Garrix was announced as an "international friend" for SOS Children's
          Village in South Africa, a non-profit organization that "builds families for orphaned, abandoned, and other
          vulnerable children around the world." Speaking to
          <em>Billboard</em>, he said "it is awful that so many
          children
          around the world don't have the support of a caring family."</p>

        <p class="info__text">On 28 February 2019, Garrix visited the SOS Children's Village in South Africa while on
          tour for Ultra South Africa. During his visit Garrix performed a one-hour DJ set to an excited crowd of one
